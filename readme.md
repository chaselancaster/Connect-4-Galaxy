# Galaxy 4
___

Galaxy 4 is a Connect 4 influenced game with a unique space theme! The game supports two players and plays out just like the traditional game. The first player to place 4 discs in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins. 

The game board features 7 columns with 6 slots in each. Players have the option of choosing the Earth, Moon, Mars, or Neptune as their "disc". 

Once players have inputted their names, selected their disc, and pressed play, the game board will appear and the playing can begin! Player 1 is always the first to start. Each player will then alernate placing one disc in the column of their choice. The discs appear from the bottom up. 

The first player that successfuly lines up 4 discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game and a point is added to their player column. From there, the board can be cleared with the reset button if they choose to play another game. The win count will carry over upon reset. If not, the home button will return them back to the starting screen clearing both names and wins.

## Getting Started

To start playing Galaxy 4, please use this link: [Galaxy 4](https://chaselancaster.github.io/Connect-4-Galaxy/)

To get started, simply input a Player 1 and Player 2 name, select discs for each player, and then press play! 

Player 1 is the starting player and they can choose any column to place their disc in. Once their disc has been placed, it is now Player 2's turn. If you ever lose track of whose turn it is, feel free to reference the "Current Player" box above the game board. 

If you would like to continue playing after a winner has been declared, simply hit the reset button.  The board will be cleared and the win counts will carry over into the new game.

Thank you for playing!

## Next Steps

In the future, I would love to add:

* An animated star background that isn't distracting to the players.
* Animated discs so that they drop into the columns rather than just appearing.
* Sound effects when a disc is placed. 
* Elegant fade-in and fade-out effects for the gameboard and boxes when play is clicked. 
* Fade-in on the Galaxy 4 Header.
